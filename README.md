# RivalClans

**Description:** Basic template of RTS game, like Clash of Clans

**Engine:** Unity 2018.2.8f1

**Target Platform:** Anroid and Editor

**Test Device:** Lenovo Vibe P1ma40

**Test Device Resolution:** 1280x720 (16:9)

**3rd Party Frameworks:** None

**Dependency:** .json file for building data (/StreamingAssets/buildings.json)

**Known Issues and notes:** 
* Camera zoom function is not implemented.
* Saving current session is not implemented for idle state. Save only occurs after some specific actions to decrease load on disk.
* Unique colored popup menu for Category2 buildings is not implemented.
* Pre-occupy objects randomly selected from buildings. Therefore, I didn't let those objects change the remaining amount of available buildings and add interests of building costs.
